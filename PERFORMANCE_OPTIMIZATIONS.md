# Performance Optimizations Applied

This document summarizes all the performance optimizations applied to the POS system to improve database and API response times.

## 1. Database Indexes (Priority 1)

### Added indexes to the following tables:

#### Orders Table
- `createdAt` - For date-based queries
- `paymentStatus` - For filtering by payment status
- `deliveryStatus` - For filtering by delivery status
- `customerId` - For customer-specific order queries
- Composite indexes:
  - `(paymentStatus, createdAt)` - For paid orders by date
  - `(deliveryStatus, createdAt)` - For delivered orders by date
  - `(customerId, createdAt DESC)` - For customer order history

#### OrderItem Table
- `orderId` - For order-specific item queries
- `itemId` - For item sales history
- Composite index `(orderId, itemId)` - For order item lookups

#### Customer Table
- `name` - For customer search
- `whatsapp` - For WhatsApp lookups (unique)

#### Item Table
- `categoryId` - For category-based filtering
- `unit` - For unit-based queries
- `stockMode` - For stock mode filtering

### Implementation
Indexes are defined in `prisma/schema.prisma` and can be applied with:
```bash
npx prisma db push
```

## 2. Query Optimizations (Priority 2)

### Orders API (`src/app/api/orders/route.ts`)
- Replaced `include` with explicit `select` to fetch only needed fields
- Reduced data transfer by selecting specific columns
- Added response caching (30 seconds)

### Dashboard API (`src/app/api/dashboard/route.ts`)
- Consolidated 9 parallel queries into 4 optimized queries
- Single-pass aggregation for profit, items, and customers
- Reduced data fetching with better selectivity
- Added response caching (2 minutes)
- Fixed TypeScript errors

### Items API (`src/app/api/items/route.ts`)
- Replaced `include` with explicit `select` to fetch only needed fields
- Added response caching (5 minutes)

### Customers API (`src/app/api/customers/route.ts`)
- Added response caching (2 minutes)

### Categories API (`src/app/api/categories/route.ts`)
- Replaced full fetch with specific field selection
- Added response caching (10 minutes)

## 3. Connection Pooling (Priority 3)

Updated `src/lib/prisma.ts` to:
- Configure connection limits for better concurrent request handling
- Added query logging in development to identify slow queries
- Optimized for Neon PostgreSQL connection handling

## 4. Response Caching (Priority 4)

Added appropriate cache headers to all APIs:
- Orders: 30 seconds (frequently changing)
- Dashboard: 2 minutes (metrics change moderately)
- Items: 5 minutes (relatively static data)
- Customers: 2 minutes (moderately changing)
- Categories: 10 minutes (rarely changing)

## Expected Performance Improvements

1. **Database queries**: 50-80% faster with indexes
2. **API response times**: 30-50% reduction from query optimization
3. **Concurrent requests**: 20-30% improvement from connection pooling
4. **Repeated requests**: Near-instant with caching

## Testing the Improvements

1. After database connection is restored:
   ```bash
   npx prisma db push
   ```

2. Test the performance by:
   - Loading the dashboard (should be much faster)
   - Navigating between pages
   - Creating new orders

3. Monitor the console in development mode to see query execution times

## Additional Recommendations

1. Consider implementing Redis for more advanced caching if needed
2. Add database query monitoring in production
3. Consider implementing request debouncing for search APIs
4. Add pagination to the dashboard API if data grows significantly
